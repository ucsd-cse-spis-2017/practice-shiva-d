# practice-shiva-d

I'm from LA and I hope during SPIS I can get more comfortable with programming and the UCSD campus as well as make friends.
I spend most of my time outside of school with friends or in band practice - I was in my school's marching band, drumline, orchestra, and jazz band. 
Other than that, I'm vegan, I have 2 dogs, and I look forward to meeting everyone here. :)
